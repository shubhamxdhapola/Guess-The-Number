This Python script implements an interactive number guessing game where users specify a range and attempt to guess a randomly generated number within that range. The game follows these key steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The game starts by defining a constant line `LINE` for formatting output.
   
2. **Range Specification**:
   - The function `get_specified_range()` prompts the user to input the starting and ending range of numbers. It includes error handling to ensure the inputs are valid integers.

3. **User Input**:
   - The function `get_user_input()` prompts the user to guess the number and ensures that the input is a valid integer.

4. **Game Play**:
   - The function `play_game()` generates a random number within the specified range. The user has 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
   - After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number.
   - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays the remaining attempts after each guess.
   - If the user guesses correctly within the allowed attempts, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts taken, the score, and the accuracy percentage.
   - If the user fails to guess the number within 10 attempts, the game reveals the correct number and displays a "Game Over" message.

5. **Game Loop**:
   - The function `number_guessing_game()` introduces the game and explains the rules.
   - It contains a loop that allows the user to play multiple rounds of the game. After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. The game exits if the user chooses not to play another round.

6. **Main Function**:
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the game starts when the script is run directly.

This script provides a user-friendly and engaging way to test and improve number guessing skills, with clear instructions and feedback at each step.
