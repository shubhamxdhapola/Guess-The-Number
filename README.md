This Python script is an interactive Number Guessing Game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. 
The game provides a fun way for users to test their guessing skills and gives feedback on each guess, including the number of attempts remaining. 
It also allows users to play multiple rounds if they wish.

#Key Features:
Game Introduction:

The script starts by displaying a welcome message and brief instructions on how to play the game.
It prompts the user to enter the starting and ending range for the random number.
Random Number Generation:

Using the random.randint() function, the script generates a random number within the specified range.
Gameplay Loop:

The player has 10 attempts to guess the number.
For each guess, the script provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low.
The number of remaining attempts is displayed after each guess.
Win/Lose Conditions:

If the player guesses the correct number, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game ends.
If the player runs out of attempts without guessing the number, a game over message is shown along with the correct number.
Scoring System:

Upon winning, the script calculates and displays the number of attempts used, the score (remaining attempts out of 10), and the accuracy percentage.
Play Again Option:

After each game, the player is asked if they want to play again.
If the player chooses to play again, the game restarts.
If the player chooses not to play again, the game exits with a goodbye message.
